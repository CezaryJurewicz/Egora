                    <p>I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should always be open to examining any of our own ideas,
                    especially if we intend to hold public office.</p>
                    <p>II &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to examine our ideas is to make them as
                    transparent as possible to ourselves and to others.</p>
                    <p>III &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The International Logic Party as an organization will never
                    dictate to anyone what is logical and what is not. All disagreements
                    about logicality will be settled on a peer to peer basis between Party
                    Members, regardless of any of their Party standing.</p>
                    <p>IV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highest administrative leadership of the Party consists of
                    only one Filosofos Vasileus/Vasileessa (FV). The role of the FV is to
                    maintain their own Egora and algorithm. Anyone who claims to be
                    the FV may be the FV; it is the role of the Party Members to decide
                    which FV to follow.</p>
                    <p>V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any candidate running a campaign for the Party nomination or
                    for a public office with the Party nomination may accept funding
                    towards their campaign only from the Party, through the proper
                    channel of Egora. Any donations received by the candidate through
                    outside means may be used only to promote the Party itself.</p>
