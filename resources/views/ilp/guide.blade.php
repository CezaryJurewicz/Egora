                        <p><b>Introduction:</b> Like any other political party, the International Logic Party must have an
                        effective leadership structure: a) to promote the Party to the electorate and the population at
                        large, b) to ensure that the Party candidates have a support network during the time of
                        elections, and c) to ensure that the Party is able to operate within the legal constraints of any
                        jurisdiction. The proper procedures for the ILP to establish its official administrative
                        leadership are described on <a href='https://gofundme.com/Egora-ILP23'>gofundme.com/Egora-ILP23</a>. However, prior to the completion of
                        the construction of the Egora—which will enable the implementation of these procedures—this
                        document provides the procedures for enacting a provisional leadership structure. Here are
                        described the purpose, nature, establishment, management, and operation of the Provisional
                        Administrative Leadership (PAL) of the International Logic Party (ILP).</p>
<p><b>Purpose of PAL:</b>
<ul>
<li>The primary purpose of the PAL is to expedite the construction of the Egora by
    facilitating the networking and fundraising efforts to complete the Egora.</li>
<li>The secondary purpose of the PAL is to grow the Party ranks, so the ILP will already
    have a member/user base for Egora upon it’s completion.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Nature of PAL:</b> The PAL of the ILP consists of four levels of officers, each with a different
scope of authority and responsibility. These officer levels all fall under the highest rank of
Filosofos Vasileus/Vasileessa (translating to Philosopher King/Queen, abbreviated FV ), which
is currently the only ILP administrative leadership position that is officially and properly
established (per the June 18, 2018 ILP Principles).</p>
<ol>
<li>The first-–i.e. lowest––PAL officer rank is Filosofos tou Dromou (Philosopher of the
Street, FD). The FD serves as an organizer for the ILP in their local area and is the main link
between the Party leadership and its members.</li>
<li>The next PAL officer rank up is Filosofos tis Polis (Philosopher of the City, FP). FP
serves as an organizer for the ILP in their municipality or grouping of towns and villages, i.e.
“Polis”.</li>
<li>The next PAL officer rank up is Filosofos tis Gis (Philosopher of the Land, FG). FG
serves as an organizer for the ILP in their regional subdivision. This rank may be omitted in
nations without regional subdivisions.</li>
<li>The highest PAL officer rank and the highest officer rank for any nation is Filosofos
Ethnikos (Ethnic Philosopher, FE). FE serves as the main organizer for their national branch of
the ILP.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Establishment of PAL:</b> All PAL officers will serve a term of up to one year and one day. The
annual term cycle for holding an office will begin and expire on February 23rd, inclusive of
both days. Office terms may begin after February 23rd, in case of any delay or need of
replacement, but will always end on February 23rd.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Filosofos tou Dromou (FD) is the only PAL officer that is appointed, rather than
elected. The FD is appointed by the FV after the officer candidate––an ILP member with an
Ideological Profile on Egora-ILP.org––has submitted a petition to the FV for becoming an FD
and the petition is accepted and verified by the FV. The FV will maintain a published list of
FD’s to facilitate their further organization at higher levels.<br/>
The petition to become an FD will consist of a certain number of unique names of ILP
members from the applicant’s nation, members who support that person becoming an FD for
the specified term (to clarify, each ILP member may sponsor only one FD at a time). The
number of names in the petition will be 23 at minimum, but that number may be raised by the
FE at a latter time. Additionally, the petition will specify into which Polis the FD will
subordinate. The petition may be submitted as early as January 26th prior to that term cycle
and must be submitted by January 26th to ensure appointment by February 23rd.</li>
<li>The Filosofos tis Polis (FP) is elected from and by the FD-s who are subordinates for
that specific Polis (including the current FP, in case of reelection). The voting body for the FP
must number at least 23 FD-s. The election of the Filosofos tis Polis will be held on February
23rd, with the exception of refilling the position in case of early vacancy. To qualify as a
candidate for FP, one must have served as an FD in the previous term.</li>
<li>The Filosofos tis Gis (FG) is an optional position that exists in a nation that requires an
additional administrative level. It will be left to the discretion of each FP whether to self-
organize into regions of at least 5 Polises per region (lead by an FG).<br/>
The FG is elected from any of the FP-s who have served in the previous term (or is
reelected). The voting body will consist of the current FG, all FP-s and all FD-s of that region.
The election of the FG will be held on February 23rd, with the exception of refilling the
position in case of early vacancy.</li>
<li>The Filosofos Ethnikos (FE) is elected from any of the FG-s, FP-s, or FD-s who have
served in the previous term (or is reelected). FP-s and FD-s will be equally eligible to become
FE; however, they will be lacking the additional experience of recently holding a higher office.
The voting body will consist of the current FE, all FG-s, all FP-s, and all FD-s of that nation;
also, the voting body must number at least 46 FD-s. The election of the FE will be held on
February 23rd, with the exception of refilling the position in case of early vacancy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, at the end of their term, any officer who does not become elected to the same or higher
rank will have to repetition, if they wish to again become an FD.</p>

<p><b>Management of PAL:</b> The management of the PAL is designed to be as decentralized as
possible. Each officer holds their position or advances to a higher one based on how
effectively they organize the ILP membership and support the operations of those below them.
The higher ranking officers do not have the authority to reprimand the lower ranking officers,
but they do hold successively more respectable positions and consequently have progressively
more influence in organizing their national branch of the ILP. Ultimately, it is up to the FE to
reach an agreement with the FV on the specific terms according to which the FE will organize
their branch of the ILP in the FV’s Egora.</p>

<p><b>Operation of PAL:</b> The operation of the PAL is also designed to be as decentralized as
possible. The higher ranking officers never give any orders to the lower ranking officers, but
they all collaborate on growing and developing the ILP. Thus, this process allows all officers to
exercise their maximum creativity in achieving our common objectives.</p>
<p>Following is a list of some of the various ways in which the PAL officers can engage
themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post original Facebook statuses about the ILP and repost those of others.</li>
<li>Reach out to Facebook users in various groups that may pertain to philosophy, politics,
etc.; share with them the “Blueprints for Intelligent Democracy”; ask for their feedback and
discuss it; and invite them to join the “ILP Members: Egora Discussions” group.</li>
<li>Facilitate the development of an “intelligent democracy” culture among the users of
“Egora: Version Sigma” by engaging with the users, guiding them in the Ideological Profile
creation process, and participating in the various discussions held within the “ILP Members:
Egora Discussions” group.</li>
<li>Communicate with one another in the “ILP Leadership Only” Facebook group to share
experiences, teach strategies, distribute useful materials, organize joint efforts to resonate our
message, and develop our leadership skills.</li>
<li>Visit college campuses to host an information table and to organize an ILP student club.</li>
<li>Establish partnerships with small local businesses, particularly ‘intellectual cafes’ and
‘progressive restaurants’, to promote the ILP through the business.</li>
<li>Distribute leaflets promoting ILP meetings, such as in person or on car windshields.</li>
<li>Organize a Meetup.com group for the ILP.</li>
<li>Develop other ways in which the officers can engage themselves.</li>
