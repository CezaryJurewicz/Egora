                        <p><b>Introduction</b><br/> Like any other political party, the International Logic Party (ILP) must have an effective leadership
                        structure: </p>
                        <p class="ml-5">
                            a) to promote the Party to the electorate and to the population at large,<br/>
                            b) to ensure that the Party candidates have a support network during the time of elections, and<br/>
                            c) to ensure that the Party is able to operate within the legal constraints of every jurisdiction.<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The official ILP leadership structure for each nation will be established by an elected
                        representative of that nation and the <i>Filosofos Vasileus</i> of the ILP, both of whom will work closely
                        together to arrive at mutually agreeable terms. The elected representative of a nation will be called the
                        <i>Filosofos Ethnikos</i>, or National Philosopher, and they will be elected using the protocol laid out in this
                        document.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, until the official administrative leadership of the ILP is created, the protocol in this
                        document will serve to create the Provisional Administrative Leadership (PAL) of the ILP. The PAL
                        will have two goals:</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">
                            a) to promote the Party to the electorate and to the population at large, and <br/>
                            b) to progress the Party toward official operations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p><b>Structure of PAL</b><br/>
                        The PAL of the ILP consists of four levels of officers, each with a different scope of authority and
                        responsibility. These officer levels all fall under the highest rank of <i>Filosofos Vasileus/Vasileessa</i>
                        (Philosopher King/Queen, abbreviated <i>FV</i>), which was officially established by the June 18, 2018 ILP
                        Principles.</p>

                        <ol>
                        <li>The lowest PAL officer rank is <i>Filosofos tou Dromou</i> (Philosopher of the Street, <i>FD</i>). The <i>FD</i>
                        serves as an administrator of the ILP in their local area and is the main link between the Party
                        Membership and the Party leadership.</li>
                        <li>The next PAL officer rank is <i>Filosofos tis Polis</i> (Philosopher of the City, <i>FP</i>). The <i>FP</i> serves as
                        an administrator of the ILP in their municipality (or grouping of small municipalities), called Polis.</li>
                        <li>The next PAL officer rank is <i>Filosofos tis Gis</i> (Philosopher of the Land, <i>FG</i>). The <i>FG</i> serves as
                        an administrator of the ILP in their regional subdivision. This rank is absent in nations without regional
                        subdivisions.</li>
                        <li>The highest PAL officer rank––the highest rank for any nation––is <i>Filosofos Ethnikos</i> (National
                        Philosopher, <i>FE</i>). The <i>FE</i> serves as the main administrator for their national branch of the ILP.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><b>Establishment of PAL officers</b><br/> The <i>Filosofoi tou Dromou</i> are the only officers who are appointed by the <i>FV</i>, with the support of ILP
                        Members, and they will maintain their position as long as they maintain their support from the
                        Members. All other PAL officers will be elected, and they will serve a term of up to one year and one
                        day. The term for elected officers will begin and expire on February 23rd, inclusive of both days;
                        however, office terms may begin after February 23rd in case of delay or replacement.</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>The <i>Filosofos tou Dromou</i> (<i>FD</i>) is automatically appointed by the <i>FV</i> through the Egora as soon
                        as an ILP Member officer-petitioner has completed an officer petition. A petition is complete when the
                        officer-petitioner has received the support of at least 23 ILP Members from their own nation (each ILP
                        Member can support only one <i>FD</i> at a time, from any Polis). If an <i>FD</i>’s support falls below 23 people
                        on their petition, they will lose their officer status.<br/>
                        Additionally, when an officer-petitioner first opens their petition, they will specify their Polis.
                        An officer’s Polis is a self-determined category that enables subordination into higher levels of
                        leadership, once appointed.</li>

                        <li>The <i>Filosofos tis Polis</i> (<i>FP</i>) is elected from and by the <i>FD</i>s who are subordinates for that
                        specific Polis. The voting body must number at least 23 <i>FD</i>s. The election of the <i>Filosofos tis Polis</i> will
                        be held on January 26th, with the exception of refilling the position in case of early vacancy.</li>

                        <li>The <i>Filosofos tis Gis</i> (<i>FG</i>) is an optional position that exists in nations that require an additional
                        administrative level. It will be left to the discretion of each <i>FP</i> whether to self-organize into regions of
                        at least 5 Polities per region, which will then be lead by an <i>FG</i>.<br/>
                        The <i>FG</i> is elected from any of the <i>FP</i>s or <i>FG</i>s who have served in the previous term. The
                        voting body will consist of any <i>FD</i>s and <i>FP</i>s subordinated to that region, and must number at least 115
                        <i>FD</i>s and 5 <i>FP</i>s. The election of the <i>FG</i> will be held between January 26th and February 23rd, with the
                        exception of refilling the position in case of early vacancy.</li>

                        <li>The <i>Filosofos Ethnikos</i> (<i>FE</i>) is elected from and by the <i>FD</i>s, <i>FP</i>s, and <i>FG</i>s of the nation. The
                        voting body must number of at least 23 <i>FD</i>s and at least one <i>FP</i>. The election of the <i>FE</i> will be held on
                        February 23rd, with the exception of refilling the position in case of early vacancy.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><b>Operations and Management of PAL</b><br/> The operations and management of the PAL are designed to be as decentralized as possible. Each
                        officer holds their position or advances to a higher one based on how effectively they organize the ILP
                        Membership and support the operations of those below them. The higher ranking officers never give
                        any orders to the lower ranking officers, but they all collaborate on growing and developing the ILP.
                        Thus, this process allows all officers to exercise their maximum creativity in achieving our common
                        objectives. Furthermore, the higher ranking officers do not have the authority to reprimand the lower
                        ranking officers, but they do hold progressively more influential positions in their national branch of
                        the ILP.</p>
